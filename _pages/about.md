I am a PhD candidate at [Korea University Business School](https://biz.korea.ac.kr/main/main.html). 

My research interests broadly span international business, international finance, and corporate finance. Specifically, I focus on examining how different forms of international capital flows—such as foreign direct investment, foreign exchange reserves, and international portfolio investments—influence the financing decisions of local firms. My work has been published in internationally recognized journals, including Emerging Markets Review, and presented at prominent conferences such as the Academy of International Business and the European International Business Academy.
